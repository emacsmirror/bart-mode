* Installation and setup
In your config file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/bart-mode")
  (require 'bart-mode)
#+END_SRC
The default station can be set with ~bart-rtd-station~ which must be set to a recognized station abbreviation.
For example, to set your default station to civic center:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq bart-rtd-station "civc")
#+END_SRC

* Usage
To view real time bart departures:
: M-x bart
use =s= to select another station or =q= to quit.

* API key
Bart-mode comes with the public API key. If BART revokes this key due to abuse you may have to register for your 
own at http://api.bart.gov/api/register.aspx
